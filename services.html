        <h3>Business Solutions</h3>
        <p> I have been described as a great listener and that is the start of finding a Business Solution.
          Delivering a complete solution for a business requirement is my work.
           Working with people who know their business is a pleasure and an honour. Understanding their business requirements and then creating a solution that meets their needs and customers wants has allowed their business to run smoother.

        <h3>Web Development</h3>
        <p>Since my studies in computer science I have obtained experience in the real world. Initially with Front-End Web Sites, using CMS Joomla & Wordpress, I then moved to professional corporate Responsive Websites in HTML5 using Bootstrap, Javascript, CCS3, Sass and Jquery.
          In order to deliver complete solutions, I turned to Back-End development and with training, I am now delivering solutions on the Google Cloud Platform. </p>

        <h3>The Cloud</h3>
        <p>The Cloud is important to us all, both users and IT developers. Giving businesses the advantage in removing the worries of investment in expensive hardware and providing solutions with highly controlled running costs. The Cloud offers many IT platforms and I have focused on the highly secure, highly resilient real-time solutions delivered on Google Cloud Platform. In The Cloud I have running Python applications, I have created Databases that are resilient against unexpected failures and where data are encrypted.</p>

          <p>Ecommerce is fast becoming the must have for many businesses. I am able to design a space where you can sell your products and accept payment in an efficient way.
